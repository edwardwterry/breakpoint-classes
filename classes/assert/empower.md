It doesn’t take long for new users of Linux, an alternative operating system to Windows or MacOS, to discover the ‘sudo’ command, which is short for ‘superuser do’. This will grant them the power to do whatever they want in the system, including potentially ruining it with a few keystrokes!

There are many commands which will be denied to a user who does not use this keyword, raising the error ‘Permission denied’. With this great power comes great responsibility.

Our aspirations for more of what we truly desire are most frequently hampered by our unconscious or conscious mind (the operating system) denying us permission, on the pretense that it might cause irreparable damage to its host. In some cases, the level of caution is appropriate, as a true threat is posed, especially if a user cannot wield the power responsibly. In other cases, this actually imposes an unnecessary constraint on what the user wants to do, and can do responsibly.
