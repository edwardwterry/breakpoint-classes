## .resist()

# 🔬

The symbol presented on this card represents a resistor in electronics circuit diagrams. A resistor is a component which reduces current in an electrical circuit. It is a bottleneck of sorts, and can be related to a mechanical analogy of a pipe carrying water. The thinner the pipe, the more resistance it offers, and vice versa.

This card represents obduracy, perseverance and strength in the face of external pressure. There is always an optimal range of resistances for a given application, in the same way that we are best off to adapt how steadfast we are about a matter to the circumstances.
