## .stabilize()

# 🔬

This card shows the typical behavior of what is known as an underdamped spring-mass-damper system, such as a car suspension, that is freely oscillating. After a while the magnitude of the oscillations reduces as the system stabilizes.

Finding stability in your relationship, career or living situation implies a level of consistency and slow rate of change. Indeed, it is the state in which longer-term goals can be realized because certain major supporting factors can be more or less taken for granted. The period of time leading up to this state can be quite exhausting and disorienting (and also exciting and energizing), as you swing in one direction, then another.

- What are your long-term goals which are being delayed because the circumstances which might otherwise support them are too unstable? 
- If there are multiple circumstances which depend on each other, is there one which would pave the way for the others to unfold, if it was resolved?
