To live through the pandemic of 2020 is to become acquainted with the dynamics of exponential, or compound, growth. Prior to this, we might have only encountered this phenomenon in compounding retirement savings accounts. By now, we have been saturated with this graphic and its association with the upheaval that beset the world during that year. 

Nonetheless, let us explore the three curves depicted here. Compared to the upper curve with the lightest shade, the two other curves show a delayed start, one with the same growth rate, and the other with a higher growth rate.

Let‚Äôs consider what lies on the vertical axis to be a skill you want to acquire. This sort thing takes time to build not necessarily because it is hard but rather because we need to visit lots of dead ends; there are lots more ways to do something wrong than to do it right, so more time on task increases the number of dead ends you can visit, helping to orient you towards what is correct.

If the vertical axis in this card represents something you wish accomplish, the key teaching here is to start early and be consistent. Small, frequent gains will result in a better final outcome.

If you start late, and try to make up for lost time by going quicker, you may eventually surpass the original curve, albeit with more effort. The worst overall outcome is to start in between the two. 

So if you wish to accomplish something complex, start early!

- What is the longest you‚Äôve stuck with something you were aiming for? What was the process like and what was the outcome? 
- For an existing goal you have, what is a really small act you could do every day for the next seven days to taste this effect?
