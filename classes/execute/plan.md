## .plan()

# 🔬

It is an important task for a mobile robot to be able to plan its path from a start point to an end point. Multiple algorithms are available, but a common one is called A* (“A Star”). The path between the start and end points here is the shortest possible option. This diagram shows a birds-eye view of a room, with the free space subdivided into white grid cells. The orange cells are obstacles and the yellow cells are the shortest path. Owing to the obstacles, the complete path is not available in a direct shot; instead it is solved by pointing towards the goal, trying to move in that direction, and if there is an obstacle, diverting around it. Even if there is only a very narrow opening, the ‘pressure’ of the algorithm’s repetition will ultimately result in a path to the goal.

To the extent that the work of personal development is to recognize your present position, set a goal, and navigate a path towards it, this could be the only card in this deck and it would still be worth it! The key insights from this card are: Firstly, head in the general direction of the goal. Secondly, you can only move one step at a time. Thirdly, your path may have to deviate around obstacles, and compared to the as-the-crow-flies route, it may even look like you’re going backwards. But the mathematical proof that the algorithm is optimal and as long as a path exists, you will reach it, should give you enough confidence to continue.

- What are examples of obstacles you’ve faced in the past which at the time seemed insurmountable but which you eventually overcame?

- For a goal you are currently working on, are you taking unnecessary diversions? What would a more direct route look like?
- When an obstacle forces you to divert, how can you remind yourself that you are still heading towards your destination?
