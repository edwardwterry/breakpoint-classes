## .recurse()

# 🔬

This card shows the principle of recursion, which is seen here as a basic fractal: a graphic which is self-similar at different scales. This particular example is known as a Sierpinski triangle. Notice that the upper triangle has an alternating black-white pattern of the biggest triangle. This diagram shows the first three levels of recursion, and it could go on forever. 

# 🧩

The concept of recursion is equivalent to saying “the way you do one thing is the way you do everything”. To the extent that our reality is the sum total of our moment-to-moment decisions, each of which is actually quite simple, it stands to reason that the outcomes should be self-similar, on both a macro and micro scale.

- What is an example of how a simple habit of yours manifests itself at both a small and a large scale? If you were to adjust how you express the habit at a small scale, describe how it might propagate to a larger scale.
