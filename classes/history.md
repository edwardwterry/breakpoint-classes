## A history of the Breakpoint Classes card deck, as told by creator Ed Terry

This card deck is a culmination of my many years of exposure to computer science, math and engineering along with a more recent focus on personal development. In the latter tradition, the objective is to reach a greater depth of understanding of ourselves by reflecting on why we behave the way we do, and what mindset shifts may need to occur to achieve what we desire. In these technical disciplines, we seek to understand and shape the world by formulating basic and general models which we can apply to novel situations. As I followed graduate studies in Robotics, it became apparent that the models we were using to design robot cognition could be applied to visualizing and understanding our own cognition. While the majority of the cards are a nod to branches of computer science, there is also a grab-bag of concepts from adjacent disciplines. These three technical disciplines are considered to be separate but have interdependent elements. I have chosen them mainly because I have had some exposure to each of them; there are probably a vast number of principles in other disciplines which could be applied to achieve the same outcome.

This card deck can be appreciated by both a technical and non-technical audience. If you have a technical background and have less exposure to the personal development angle, I intend that the illustrations and concepts can act as a bridge to a new practice, which has been immensely impactful for me. I hope that if you have the type of mind that likes to build things from verifiable first principles, you will be able to make the connection to concepts which may have felt too esoteric until being framed in a more familiar way. If you do not have a technical background, I hope that you will be able to pick up some useful tidbits of knowledge and learn about into some of the principles which are found in much of the technology that you use every day with the help of the organic illustrations. The reflection prompts are intended to be universal.
