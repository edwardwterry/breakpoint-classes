We usually think of mesh as a type of tightly-woven fabric which distributes the load that it carries through many redundant pathways. A similar concept applies to communication networks, in which a signal may take multiple routes from its source to its destination. The benefit is that while multiple individual elements may fail, the overall system can continue to function.

In a computer science context, a mesh is a type of *graph*, and not the type that you may produce in Microsoft Excel. Instead, it is a collection of what is known as *nodes* and *edges*. In this case, the nodes are the black circles, and the edges are the lines connecting them.

A more accessible way to understand this concept is to consider your own social circles, which probably looks a lot like a mesh network. You are directly connected to your first degree friends, and some of them may be connected to each other. At a larger scale, it is no coincidence that we use the expression ‚Äú*fabric* of society‚Äù. This image expresses the redundant and diverse connections between individuals, and expresses the ability of the resulting organism to self-regulate and to compensate for individual weakness or struggle.

- Think of two people you know from different social or professional circles. What common ground could you find between them? 
- Are there single points of failure in your relationships and career? 
- How can you diversify to improve resilience to unforeseen circumstances?
