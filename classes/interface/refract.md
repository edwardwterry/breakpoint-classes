## .refract()

# 🔬

We see in this card a representation of a light ray moving first through air then through glass and back into air. The deviation from its original path when it encounters a different medium is called refraction.

Every act of perception is also an act of refraction, in which a raw signal moves from one medium to another. The medium through which the light bends is also imperfect, which may distort it beyond the ideal case. The intent and meaning behind your expression cannot be fully conveyed, and there can only ever be partial overlap with another’s experience. As our words are received, they filter through a listener’s life lens and may well be interpreted in a manner different from our intent. 

This is not inevitable. It can be addressed by approaching the conversation from a place of curiosity, detachment from a particular outcome and with a beginner’s mind.

- To get a feel for the breadth of interpretations available of another’s words, consider this partnered exercise. Choose an object in the room and describe an aspect of it in different tones of voice and with different emphasis. Ask your partner to reflect back how each one made them feel and what their instinctive reaction was, then switch places.
