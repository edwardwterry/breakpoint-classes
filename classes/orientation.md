### *Welcome to the digital companion for the Breakpoint Classes card deck!*

Navigate to each card by clicking on its corresponding image. 

When you arrive at the detail for the card, you will notice three icons. Let’s step through them:

# 🔬 

The text beside the Microscope explains the meaning of the card in its original technical context. Don’t worry if some of the terms are unfamiliar; this section is mainly intended as interesting background information if you don’t have a technical background.

# 🧩

The text beside the Puzzle Piece explains the meaning of the card in a personal development or spiritual context. 

# 🖋️

The text beside the pen contains question prompts which may facilitate ongoing reflection. 

# 📚

In some cases there are links to supplementary material to help you deepen your knowledge of a concept.
